# Matplotlib-Challenge
To start off, we merged our csv files.
We then check the mice count and clear the data frame of any errors/duplicates. 
Next, we get the statistics summary on the drug regimens and the tumor volume. 
In order to add visuals, we show bar and pie plots for the mice and their time points. 
Then, we want to find the outliers in our data set and find that Infubinols has outliers in the data set. 
To get more specific, we test a mouse tumor volume vs their time point and can conclude that within a matter of time, the tumor volume decreases significantly.
In this data set study, we learn that the drug, Capomulin, can reduce tumor sizes significantly compared to the other drug regimens based on mice size and tumor size.
